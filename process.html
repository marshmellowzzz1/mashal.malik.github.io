        <p>For my standalone website I categorized my inner pages to the about page, projects page, resume page, and contact page. For my about page I designed it using the parallax scrolling effect. I wanted a page to express myself and who I am in an aesthetic way to build my online personality. However, my favourite page is my projects page. I started off with a carousel presenting what kind of content the page holds. Then I used various effects to display my projects. I used a dark background because my photos were colourful, and I wanted them to stand out on the page. I included a photo grid, slideshow, two videos, and a modal on this page. It took me the longest to work on, but I’m satisfied with my design choices.</p><br>
        <p>For my resume page, I used the bootstrap grid system to section each part of my content. I used a resume template that I found from Acadiate to design my resume and I used a light background to make it easy to read and show formality. Lastly, I used a form on my contact page. I added a black translucent veil to the background image to make the white text more readable on the page. My colour palette was mainly black, white, and gray tones with a dash of colour here and there to add spontaneity to the site. I was going for a classy black and white look, but I didn’t want to make the site too dull. I made sure to add dark tones to light text and light tones to darker texts to fit the (WCAG) accessibility guidelines.</p><br>
        <p>To build this site I had to do a lot of research on how I want to present myself and build my online profile. I inspired myself by researching other portfolios and sticking to a simple colour palette. I also stuck to the same font throughout my site to give the inner pages the same feel of the website but a different layout and structure. I had to make sure the site was responsive as I was working on it and finally completed my project after re-reading through the assignment requirements and checking the accessibility guidelines.</p>
